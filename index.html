      <h3>The Processor</h3>
        <p>The processor, or CPU (central processing unit) is one of the most important parts of a computer. The CPU executes all the programs and commands that run on a computer. You could call it the brain of a computer. The speed of a CPU is measured in hertz and the faster a CPU is, the better. There are two main manufacturers of CPU's for computers:</p>
        <ul id="cpu">
          <li>Intel</li>
          <li>Advanced Micro Devices(AMD)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since I'm more familiar with Intel processors, here a few of their processors and specifications.</p>
        <table id="intel">
          <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Speed</th>
            <th>Cores</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Intel Core i3-6100T</td>
            <td>3.2 GigaHertz</td>
            <td>2</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Intel Core i5-6600K</td>
            <td>3.5 GigaHertz</td>
            <td>4</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Intel Core i7-6700K</td>
            <td>4.0 GigaHertz</td>
            <td>4</td>

      <h3>The Motherboard</h3>
        <p>The motherboard connects all the components of a computer together and allows them to talk to each other. This includes the CPU, RAM, Hard Drive, Graphics Card, and any and all accessories and peripherals (mouse, keyboard, monitor). Some of the more popular motherboard manufacturers are:</p>
        <ul id="mobo">
          <li>Asus</li>
          <li>Gigabyte</li>
          <li>MSI</li>
          <li>ASRock</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Power Supply</h3>
        <p>The power supply unit (PSU) provides the power and electricity to your computer. It is connected to the motherboard, hard drive, graphics card, and any fans that are in the case.</p>

      <h3>RAM</h3>
        <p>RAM stands for Random Access Memory. This is where your computer temporarily stores data that it needs to access quickly. Any program that you open will have its data temporarily stored on the computer's RAM. RAM varies in size. Most computers these days have between 4-8 GB of RAM. Popular manufacturers of RAM are:</p>
        <ul id="ram">

    <p>After scrolling past all the scripts in the beginning, I can see that this website is actually a lot like mine in that it uses similar header and paragraph elements and adds pictures to illustrate what they are talking about. There are also a lot of in-line elements linking to other articles on the same website.</p>
